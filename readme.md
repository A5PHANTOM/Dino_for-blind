# Accessible Audio BLOCK Game

An accessible web-based endless runner game specifically designed for blind, visually impaired, **cognitive, and learning disabled** players. This game reimagines the classic Chrome Dinosaur game using advanced audio cues, speech synthesis, and simplified mechanics to create an inclusive gaming experience for users with diverse abilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project addresses the lack of accessible gaming options for users with visual, cognitive, and learning disabilities by creating an audio-first gaming experience with simplified controls and clear feedback.
